This repository contains the code used to run the experiments presented in **"Classifying Freewill Pre-Movement Intentions from EEG Using Q-Learning-Based Neural Decoders in Reinforcement Learning Brain Machine Interfaces"**.

## Python files

- `main_all.py`: Main experiment. Loads the EEG dataset, applies band-pass settings, then,  train a deep Q-learning based decoder to classify premovement intention  and saves per-subject/section su[...]
- `models.py`: Neural network architectures and reinforcement-learning components used by the decoder, including the CNN+LSTM EEG classifier, an EEGNet implementation, a replay buffer, and a DQNAge[...]
- `utils.py`:  Utilities for the DQN EEG decoder, including target geometry helpers (reaching_target_xy), cursor/target step logic, per-channel standardization, the main training loop (with early s[...]
- `data_function.py`: Core EEG data utilities and preprocessing helpers (e.g., raw feature extraction and anti-aliased downsampling via Butterworth low-pass filtering + cubic-spline resampling). 
- `load_data.py`: Loader for the Freewill Reaching & Grasping `.mat` files. Walks the dataset directory, parses subject/session filenames, and returns a nested dict of loaded MATLAB structures.

- `Code_Step01_EEG_FREEFORM.ma`:  This script is used to extract RAW EEG features from Kaya's dataset.
- `Code_Step02_EEG_FREEFORM.ma`:  This script is used to implements offline center out reaching task using KTD algorithm.



## Dataset

## Dataset

This project uses the [Freewill Reaching & Grasping EEG dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_Large_Electroencephalogram_Database_of_Freewill_Reaching_and_Grasping_Tasks_for_Brain_Machine_Interfaces/27634938)

### Loading and preprocessing the data

For instructions on **downloading** the data, a walkthrough of the dataset's **folder/file structure**, and **Python scripts** to load and preprocess it, see the companion tutorial repository: [EEG_Freewill_reaching_grasping_load_data](https://github.com/sposso/EEG_Freewill_reaching_grasping_load_data).
